Explain the concept of indexing in PostgreSQL. Describe the purpose and benefits of indexing in a database system. Choose a 
specific table in your PostgreSQL database and create an appropriate index to improve query performance. Write SQL queries 
before and after creating the index to demonstrate the impact on query execution time.


- Concept of Indexing in PostgreSQL

Indexing in PostgreSQL is a technique used to optimize the performance of a database by reducing the number of 
disk I/O (Input/Output) operations needed to find and retrieve data. An index is a separate data structure that is 
created on one or more columns of a table.
For example, if you have a table of customers with an id field, creating an index on the id field would allow the 
database to quickly look up customer records by id without having to scan the entire table.


- Purpose and Benefits of Indexing

> Faster Data Retrieval: The most immediate benefit is quicker access to data. For tables with large amounts of data, 
this can mean the difference between a query taking seconds versus milliseconds.
> Boosts WHERE Clauses: If a column used in the WHERE clause of a SQL query has an index, 
the query engine can find the relevant rows much more quickly.
> Enhances JOIN Operations: Indexes on columns that are often joined can make the JOIN operation more efficient.
> Unique Constraints: You can enforce uniqueness on a column by creating a unique index, ensuring data integrity.
> Improved Sort Operations: Since indexes are sorted by design, using them can result in faster sort operations when querying the database.


- Let's assume we have a table called employees with the following schema:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT
);

- Query without an index

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;

- To speed this up, we can create an index on the department_id column:

CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department_id);

- After the index has been created, you can execute the same query:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;

- Measuring Query Execution Time

- Before Index

\timing on

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;

- After Index

CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department_id);

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;
